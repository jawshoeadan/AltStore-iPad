# AltStore-iPad
A version of AltStore that has full capabilities on iPad! May have a few hiccups here and there but has full screen support (no more letterboxing) and multitasking support.

## How to install AltStore and AltServer:
To install this version of AltStore, make sure you already have the normal version of AltStore installed on your iPad as well as AltServer installed on your computer. You can follow a guide for how to do so here on their [official website](https://altstore.io/faq/). The rest of this guide assumes you are currently connected to AltServer on your computer, you can double check that that is the case by refreshing AltStore on your iPad.

## How to install AltStore for iPad
The easiest way to install AltStore for iPad is to click [**This Link**](https://delta-skins.github.io/appinstall.html?altstore://install?url=https://github.com/jawshoeadan/AltStore-iPad/releases/download/v1.3.4/AltStore_iPad_v1.3.4.ipa) on your iPad. 

As long as you are connected to AltServer and have the current version of AltStore installed, the iPad version of AltStore will replace the current one you have. If you like, you can also download the .IPA file from the releases tab and sideload it like you would any other app for AltStore.

It is worth mentioning that this version will still completely work on iPhones as if nothing has changed so you can also install it on your iPhone if you wish. Also, I will not be posting Beta or Alpha versions of AltStore with iPad support as it is stealing from Riley. Go support him on his [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rileytestut) for access to all the Beta or Alpha features.
